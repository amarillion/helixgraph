# helixgraph

A collection of path finding & graph algorithms for game development

This library includes

* path finding algorithms such as A*, dijkstra, and breadth-first-search
* a random maze generation algorithm

The algorithms are suitable for tilemaps, regular grids, as well as (non-regular) graphs.
